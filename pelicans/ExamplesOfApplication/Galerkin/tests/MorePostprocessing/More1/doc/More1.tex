\Sect{Description}

The savings performed for possible restarts by the
calculation of \verb+MorePostprocessing/DoSaving+
are used

\begin{itemize}
\item
to compute the stream function associated to the field \verb+"velocity"+;
\item
to save the field \verb+"pressure"+ for subsequent postprocessing with the
TIC utility.
\end{itemize}

\Sect{Results}
